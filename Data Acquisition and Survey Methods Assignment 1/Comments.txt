
Initially, I would like to point out that the comments and analysis 
of the following diagrams concern the day the rmarkdown file was executed. 
The date is indicated at the beginning of the PDF report. The values may vary, 
as well as the diagrams, because according to the exercise instructions, 
the temperature, wind, and humidity values for the next 24 hours are needed.

Regarding the temperature, it is evident that throughout the day, 
the temperature rises, reaching its peak at midday (between 1 pm to 4 pm). 
From there onwards, the temperature decreases, reaching its minimum value 
during the late midnight hours. However, it is worth noting that the temperatures 
are quite high, and in combination with the humidity values during the day, it 
indicates that we are talking about an area close to the equator and therefore 
its climate is tropical.More specifically, from the humidity diagram, 
it is observed that it is inversely proportional (negative correlation) 
to the temperature. 
That is to say, during midday, the humidity is relatively low, 
while during the evening hours, when the sun sets or has set, 
it is particularly high.

Finally, the values of the wind during the day and night vary from 
day to day and from hour to hour. Generally, areas with a tropical 
climate are characterized by continuous and strong winds, which is 
evident from Figure 4. Also, there is a significant fluctuation in 
the values during the day and night. This means that the wind is not 
correlated with temperature and humidity.

Overall, as mentioned earlier, it is evident from the diagrams that 
Kingston, in Jamaica, has a tropical climate with very high 
temperatures and humidity, as well as significant fluctuations in strong winds.
