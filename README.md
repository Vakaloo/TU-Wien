# TU Wien Data Science
This GitHub repository is purely for cloud storage of individual and some group assignments in certain courses of the Data Science Master's curriculum at the Technische Universität Wien. Beyond storage, this repository serves as a way to publish my personal efforts in the courses I attended during the Master's program. Many group assignments are not included as they were not completed solely by my individual effort. Additionally, due to limited space, some individual assignments could not be published.

The files that make up the repository are either PDF files for the assignment reports, R and RMarkdown files, or .py and .ipynb files.

PS: If you are a Data Science student at the Technische Universität Wien, feel free to check my assignments and maybe help you during your studies!
