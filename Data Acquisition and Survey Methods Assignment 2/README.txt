The specific zip file contains 1 screenshot of data frame summary that was used in the
first research question because we couldn't show the table in the pdf using the summarytools library. 
Also, the PDF for the report, the R Markdown file and the final presentation in a pdf format are contained in the zip file. 
The screenshot is included in the file because it is needed to execute the R Markdown properly.
To execute the R Markdown, simply hit the knit button.

HAVE FUN!
