The Subscapularis is 1 of the 4 rotator cuff muscles, that together have a role of keeping the head of the Humerus within the Glenoid Cavity. The Subscapularis is actually the LARGEST and most POWERFUL of the 4 rotator cuff (Keating JF, JBJB, BR.. 1993). This muscle originates on the subscapular fossa of the scapula and inserts onto the lesser tuberosity of the humerus, which creates movement at the shoulder/gleno-humeral joint into internal rotation and horizontal adduction.
993320	7980993	which quarks have a positive charge	The number of protons in an atom defines what element it is. For example, carbon atoms have six protons, hydrogen atoms have one and oxygen atoms have eight. The number of protons in an atom is referred to as the atomic number of that element. The number of protons in an atom also determines the chemical behavior of the element. The Periodic Table of the Elements arranges elements in order of increasing atomic number. Three quarks make up each proton — two up quarks (each with a 2/3 positive charge) and one down quark (with a 1/3 negative charge) — and they are held together by other subatomic particles called gluons, which are massless.

994085	5697981	which law says elastic limits strain produced is proportional to the stress called	One type of stress that we are all used to is a uniform stress, called pressure. A uniform stress is a stress wherein the forces act equally from all directions. In the Earth the pressure due to the weight of overlying rocks is a uniform stress, and is sometimes referred to as confining stress. If stress is not equal from all directions then we say that the stress is a differential stress. Three kinds of differential stress occur. Tensional stress (or extensional stress), which stretches rock; Compressional stress, which squeezes rock; and; Shear stress, which result in slippage and translation. When rocks deform they are said to strain. A strain is a change in size, shape, or volume of a material. Stages of Deformation When a rock is subjected to increasing stress it passes through 3 successive stages of deformation. 1  Elastic Deformation -- wherein the strain is reversible. 2  Ductile Deformation -- wherein the strain is irreversible. 3  Fracture - irreversible strain wherein the material breaks.

994397	6326289	which ion is regulated by dietary intake, kidney	Aldosterone is a steroid secreted by the cortex of the adrenal gland. It is. the most potent hormone regulating the body's electrolyte balance. Aldosterone acts directly on the kidney to decrease the rate of sodium-ion excretion (with accompanying retention of water), and to increase the rate of potassium-ion excretion. The secretion of aldosterone appears to be regulated by two mechanisms. First, the concentration of sodium ions may be a factor since increased rates of aldosterone secretion are found when dietary sodium is severely limited. Second, reduced blood flow to the kidney stimulates certain kidney cells to secrete the proteolytic enzyme renin, which converts the inactive angiotensinogen globulin in the blood into angiotensin I. Another enzyme then converts angiotensin I into angiotensin II, its active form. This peptide, in turn, stimulates the secretion of ...
